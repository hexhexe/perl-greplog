Just a really minimalistic logviewer to allow people without
ssh access to view and grep through logfiles. It is written in
perl, html 5 and css3. You only need a webserver that can
deliver cgi scripts and the following perl modules:

File::ReadBackwards
HTML::Entities
Template-Toolkit


Installation:

You could use the script install.sh to setup the logviewer. It
needs the user the webserver is running as and you could give
it a secound parameter to specify the installation directory.
By default the logviewer is installed in /srv/http/logviewer.

./install.sh <username> <install_dir>

Add the outprinted lines to the configuration of your webserver.

Last but not least you could configure the logviewer in
/etc/logviewer.conf.


Usage:

You could find a HowTo @ the Frontend itself. Just hover over 
the HowTo Tag @ the top left of the page.
